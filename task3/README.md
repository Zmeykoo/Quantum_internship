Project Title: Prediction of target.
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the target column based on the given features in the "internship_train.csv" dataset. The model will be evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric, and predictions will be made on the "internship_hidden_test.csv" dataset.

Dataset
The "internship_train.csv" dataset contains 53 anonymized features and a target column. This dataset will be used to train and validate the model. The "internship_hidden_test.csv" dataset will be used to make predictions and evaluate the model's performance.

Model
Python 3 will be used to build the model. The appropriate machine learning algorithm will be selected for this prediction task, and techniques such as feature engineering, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning will be used to improve the model's performance. The model will be trained and validated using appropriate evaluation metrics, with the goal of minimizing the root mean squared error (RMSE).
